<u><b>About</b></u>
<p>Harkell is the website of the personal equities portfolio of Jordan Harkell Short.  The purpose of this website is to give brief detail on the constituents and investment rationale of the portfolio.</p>  

<p>The portfolio focuses on taking unleveraged, long-only positions in small-cap equities, with an average holding period of 6 months.  The portfolio seeks to take advantage of market short-termism (in the form of pessimism over temporary circumstance) and unpriced optionality in the AIM markets.  The investment process has no informational advantage and operates on the philosophy that the small-cap equities market systematically overweights the short-term.</p>

<p>The portfolio is concentrated and opportunistic.  As a result, the portfolio funds are not always fully invested.  In the instance that the portfolio is not fully invested, surplus funds are retained in cash.</p>
